This repository contains my terminal profile settings, my .zshrc file. This is mainly to serve as a backup so I can get these settings back. I also published them on Github so other people can see what settings I use if they want ideas for their own Terminals. I believe it is sufficiently commented to that it makes sense what is going on. 

I have also added my .vimrc file as reference to what I use in my vimrc. Some highlights are that I use the Plex font (https://github.com/IBM/plex) for my entire terminal and vim. My colorscheme of choice is gruvbox (https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), which I also use in dark mode.

Here is also a list of vim plugins I use:

1. Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) (my plugin manager)
2. Vim-Sensible (https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) (some default vim settings)
3. Ale (https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) (awesome linter / compile checker. It's very minimal and allows you to make way less errors)
4. LightLine (https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) (has a really nice status bar at the bottom
5. NerdTree (ctrl+o) (https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) (Allows access to the filesystem really easily)
6. Vim-Fugitive (https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) (Really nice Git wrapper)

Here is a working list of Terminal plugins I use:
1. Fuck (https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) error checks terminal commands and recomends fixes.
