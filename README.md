This repository contains my terminal profile settings, my .zshrc file. This is mainly to serve as a backup so I can get these settings back. I also published them on Github so other people can see what settings I use if they want ideas for their own Terminals. I believe it is sufficiently commented to that it makes sense what is going on. 

I have also added my .vimrc file as reference to what I use in my vimrc. Some highlights are that I use the Plex font (https://github.com/IBM/plex) for my entire terminal and vim. My colorscheme of choice is gruvbox (https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), which I also use in dark mode.

Here is also a list of plugins I use:

1. Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
2. Vim-Sensible (https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible)
3. Ale (https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) (awesome linter / compile checker. It's very minimal and allows you to make way less errors)
